# Jolicloud Robby is the latest stable release of Jolicloud 1.x. It should
# always be available on your Jolicloud system.
#
# Jolicloud utilizes OSS and non-OSS packages to find the best-possible
# mix of program to support most available hardware possible. However, some
# Jolicloud mirrors mandate that they only serve OSS software. As a result,
# "restricted" packages require their own APT source and URL.
