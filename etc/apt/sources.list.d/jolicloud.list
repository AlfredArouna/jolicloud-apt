# Jolicloud Robby is the latest stable release of Jolicloud 1.x. It should
# always be available on your Jolicloud system.
#
# Jolicloud utilizes OSS and non-OSS packages to find the best-possible
# mix of program to support most available hardware possible. However, some
# Jolicloud mirrors mandate that they only serve OSS software. As a result,
# "restricted" packages require their own APT source and URL.

# Jolicloud Robby-oem is the latest stable release of Jolicloud 1.x

# Third-party repositories, like PPAs, Ubuntu's backports, security, and
# updates, and other third-party sources are all mirrored by Jolicloud's
# APT network. These repositories contain packages that have been released
# outside or after the base Ubuntu distribution and have been tested to be
# compatibile with this Jolicloud release.
#
# Note that the direct APT URLs to Launchpad, Ubuntu and other third-party
# repositories have been removed due to the potential for these APT sources
# to release packages outside of Jolicloud's testing window.
#
# These packages will still be released for Jolicloud users, but only after
# proper testing and validation can occur by the Jolicloud QA team. The
# release conduit will be this Jolicloud mirrors source:
